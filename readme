This assignment was quite a practice about struct data types and
hash table. It took me a total of about 30 hours to complete it.
I find the assignment problems well fitted to practice to what we 
have covered in class. In my assignment, I have implemented hash
table expansion in the Registercustomer function of 
customer_management2.c file. While working in this assignment, I
have received much help from Professors, TAs, fellow classmates 
and my friend Amanuel Assefa who helped me debug my code when I 
run into segmenation faults. I am gratefull to all who helped me.

The implemenations using the array and hash table have thier 
own pros and cons.

Implementation by arrays is probably easier to implement and is not
that much error prone as compared to that of hash table. But, it is 
not efficient and the performance rate is so low. It takes longer time
to manipulate the user information and it's even worse when the number
of users is too large.

On the other hand, hash table is difficult to implement and it is more
error prone than array implementation. However, it is very much more
efficient than array expansion. User data manipulation can be done
with in fraction of seconds using hash table while array implemetation 
takes longer.
